# Sharing is by emailed invitation, addressed to an email rather than an account

People join a publication only by accepting an invitation, so nobody can be added unilaterally and inviting someone
who hasn't signed up yet just works. The owner's response is always the same `202`, whether the address has an
account, is unknown, or is already a member, so the endpoint can't be used to look people up (this replaced the
old "No account with that email" answer). Links are 7-day, hashed at rest, and bound to the invited address: the
signed-in account's email must match, so a forwarded link is useless to anyone else. Accepting from the link also
confirms the address, because the token only ever reached that inbox. Owners must have a confirmed address, and
are capped at 20 invitations a day, because each one makes our mail server email a stranger. After a Google
sign-in, a validated same-site `next` path returns people to their invitation (open redirects are rejected).
