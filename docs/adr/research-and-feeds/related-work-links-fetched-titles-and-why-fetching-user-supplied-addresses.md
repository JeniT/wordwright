# Related-work links: fetched titles, and why fetching user-supplied addresses is locked down

Links are added by address alone; the server fetches the page and keeps its `<title>` (or `og:title`) as the link's
title, shown instead of the address. A title that is wrong or missing can be edited, and clearing it fetches again.
A link is refused if the text isn't a plausible web address (`new URL("https://rubbish")` is valid, so we also
require a dot, a real-looking ending, and no embedded password), if the site's name doesn't resolve, or if the same
page is already in the idea (compared ignoring `http`/`https`, `www.`, a trailing slash and the fragment). We only
reject on a definite "no such site"; a page that is slow, blocks robots or has no title is kept, because refusing
those would make links to paywalled or bot-hostile sites impossible.

Fetching an address someone typed makes our server contact whatever they name, so it is an SSRF risk (aiming it at
`http://169.254.169.254/` or an internal service). `HttpPageInfoFetcher` therefore: contacts only public addresses,
checked when the connection is made (so a name can't be re-pointed inward after the check) and for numeric
addresses before it; follows redirects by hand, vetting each hop; only uses ports 80/443 and http(s); has a 5 s
overall deadline and reads at most 256 KB, stopping at the end of the head; sends no cookies or credentials and asks
for uncompressed HTML so the cap is real; and treats the title strictly as text (Vue escapes it; entities are decoded
but nothing is rendered as HTML). Each person may trigger 30 lookups a minute. It sits behind a port with a fake and a
contract suite like our other external services; `PAGE_FETCHER=fake` is refused in production. The lookup happens
inside the request that adds the link (up to the 5 s deadline) rather than in the background, so the person sees
the title, or the reason it was refused, straight away. Not done: a per-site politeness delay or caching.
The publication's own website field (`SiteUrlSchema`) applies the same `WebAddressSchema` check, with a 300-character
cap. It is checked only when saved, so a site stored earlier that wouldn't pass still displays, but must be
corrected or cleared the next time the publication settings are saved.
