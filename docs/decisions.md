# Decisions and rationale

Short records of non-obvious choices, so they don't get re-litigated or forgotten. Add new ones at the bottom:
**Decision → Why → Consequences/alternatives.**

## Client/server rather than a browser-only app

Why: access from several devices; secrets (LLM/search keys) can't live in a browser; background jobs (idea scans);
CORS blocks fetching most web sources from the client. Alternative considered: Nuxt full-stack (rejected for a
cleaner provider boundary and easier testing).

## TypeScript monorepo; Hono + SQLite (`node:sqlite`); Vue 3 + Tiptap + Tailwind

Hono for end-to-end types and portability; `node:sqlite` to avoid native build dependencies, behind store classes
so Postgres/Drizzle can replace it; Vue because the owner knows it; Tiptap because a writing tool lives or dies by
its editor; Tailwind + headless primitives (not Bulma) for accessible, distinctive UI.
TypeScript is pinned to 5.9 because `typescript-eslint` doesn't support 7 yet.

## Ports and adapters for every external service

Why: the owner wants to swap and combine services freely. Ports live in `packages/core`; each has a fake and a
shared contract suite. Dependencies are injected into `createApp`.

## Users bring their own LLM key; no server-wide key

Why: the service shouldn't carry users' LLM costs. OpenAI offers "Sign in with ChatGPT" (partner-led); Anthropic's
terms (Feb 2026) disallow subscription OAuth in third-party apps and point to API keys, so API keys are the common
baseline. Keys are AES-256-GCM encrypted, bound to the user id, write-only in the UI. Losing `KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`
loses all stored keys. In a shared profile, each request spends the requester's own key.

## Sessions: opaque cookie, hashed in the database

`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, 30 days; only the SHA-256 is stored; revoked on password change/deletion. Writes are also
checked against `Origin`. Chosen over JWTs so sessions can be revoked.

## Passwords: scrypt from `node:crypto`

No native dependency. Format `scrypt$N$r$p$salt$hash` lets cost be raised later without invalidating old hashes.

## Account linking and unverified emails

Local accounts start unconfirmed (T2 added confirmation links). If Google later proves control of the same address,
the unverified local account's password and sessions are **discarded** and the identity is linked, which closes the
"pre-register someone else's email" takeover. Never link on an unverified provider email.

## Account deletion semantics

Removes the user and everything only they own (including profiles where they're the sole member). In shared profiles
they're removed; if they were the owner, the longest-standing member becomes owner; drafts they wrote there remain.
Immediate, no grace period or export yet (see T11).

## Sharing requires an existing account (for now)

Simplest thing that works, but it discloses whether an email is registered. Replaced by invitations in T3.

## Tests must fail on browser errors

The first version of the e2e suite passed while the dev server was broken, because nothing watched the console.
`apps/web/e2e/fixtures.ts` now fails any test on uncaught exceptions, `console.error`, failed requests or 5xx.
The e2e API also runs on a real SQLite file so migrations are exercised.

## Email: provider-neutral SMTP; sent after responding; zero-setup default

`SmtpMailer` (nodemailer) works with any provider, so choosing Resend/Postmark/SES is configuration, not code.
`MAIL_TRANSPORT=console` is the default so local development needs no provider; `file` lets e2e tests read the
"inbox"; production refuses anything but `smtp`. Reset emails are sent in the background: awaiting the mail server
would make "this address has an account" observable through response time or a 500 when mail is down. The cost is
that a delivery failure isn't visible to the user, so it is logged (user id + SMTP error code, never the link) and
the SMTP connection is verified at startup.

## Email confirmation: gate sharing, not writing

Unconfirmed accounts can write and use AI features (nothing is exposed to anyone else), but can't share profiles
or be added to one: sharing is the one place an unproven address could leak someone's work or let a stranger in.
An unconfirmed address is reported as "no account", the same as an unknown one. Links are bound to the address they
were sent to, hashed at rest, expire after 24 hours, and only the newest works. Using a link twice succeeds, because
mail scanners and double clicks routinely open links first. Resend is limited to 3/hour per user. Chosen over
blocking sign-in until confirmed because that makes a typo'd address a dead end and turns every mail outage into
a lockout.
