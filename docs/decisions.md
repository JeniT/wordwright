# Decisions and rationale

Short records of non-obvious choices, so they don't get re-litigated or forgotten. Add new ones at the bottom:
**Decision → Why → Consequences/alternatives.**

## Client/server rather than a browser-only app

Why: access from several devices; secrets (LLM/search keys) can't live in a browser; background jobs (idea scans);
CORS blocks fetching most web sources from the client. Alternative considered: Nuxt full-stack (rejected for a
cleaner provider boundary and easier testing).

## TypeScript monorepo; Hono + SQLite (`node:sqlite`); Vue 3 + Tiptap + Tailwind

Hono for end-to-end types and portability; `node:sqlite` to avoid native build dependencies, behind store classes
so Postgres/Drizzle can replace it; Vue because the owner knows it; Tiptap because a writing tool lives or dies by
its editor; Tailwind + headless primitives (not Bulma) for accessible, distinctive UI.
TypeScript is pinned to 5.9 because `typescript-eslint` doesn't support 7 yet.

## Ports and adapters for every external service

Why: the owner wants to swap and combine services freely. Ports live in `packages/core`; each has a fake and a
shared contract suite. Dependencies are injected into `createApp`.

## Users bring their own LLM key; no server-wide key

Why: the service shouldn't carry users' LLM costs. OpenAI offers "Sign in with ChatGPT" (partner-led); Anthropic's
terms (Feb 2026) disallow subscription OAuth in third-party apps and point to API keys, so API keys are the common
baseline. Keys are AES-256-GCM encrypted, bound to the user id, write-only in the UI. Losing `KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`
loses all stored keys. In a shared profile, each request spends the requester's own key.

## Sessions: opaque cookie, hashed in the database

`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, 30 days; only the SHA-256 is stored; revoked on password change/deletion. Writes are also
checked against `Origin`. Chosen over JWTs so sessions can be revoked.

## Passwords: scrypt from `node:crypto`

No native dependency. Format `scrypt$N$r$p$salt$hash` lets cost be raised later without invalidating old hashes.

## Account linking and unverified emails

Local accounts start unconfirmed (T2 added confirmation links). If Google later proves control of the same address,
the unverified local account's password and sessions are **discarded** and the identity is linked, which closes the
"pre-register someone else's email" takeover. Never link on an unverified provider email.

## Account deletion semantics

Removes the user and everything only they own (including profiles where they're the sole member). In shared profiles
they're removed; if they were the owner, the longest-standing member becomes owner; drafts they wrote there remain.
Immediate, no grace period or export yet (see T11).

## Sharing is by emailed invitation, addressed to an email rather than an account

People join a profile only by accepting an invitation, so nobody can be added unilaterally and inviting someone
who hasn't signed up yet just works. The owner's response is always the same `202`, whether the address has an
account, is unknown, or is already a member, so the endpoint can't be used to look people up (this replaced the
old "No account with that email" answer). Links are 7-day, hashed at rest, and bound to the invited address: the
signed-in account's email must match, so a forwarded link is useless to anyone else. Accepting from the link also
confirms the address, because the token only ever reached that inbox. Owners must have a confirmed address, and
are capped at 20 invitations a day, because each one makes our mail server email a stranger. After a Google
sign-in, a validated same-site `next` path returns people to their invitation (open redirects are rejected).

## Tests must fail on browser errors

The first version of the e2e suite passed while the dev server was broken, because nothing watched the console.
`apps/web/e2e/fixtures.ts` now fails any test on uncaught exceptions, `console.error`, failed requests or 5xx.
The e2e API also runs on a real SQLite file so migrations are exercised.

## Profiles are venues, and ids are `<handle>-<slug>`

The existing profile (a container with members and drafts) _is_ the publishing venue the owner described, so it
was extended rather than adding a second concept. Profile URLs get shared, so ids are readable: users get a
`handle`, and a profile's id is `<creator's handle>-<slug of name>`. **Handles contain no `-`**, which makes the
split unambiguous: otherwise handle `jen` + profile `it-substack` and handle `jenit` + profile `substack` would
both be `jenit-substack`. The id is fixed at creation (renaming doesn't change it, so links keep working) and
belongs to the creator's handle even if ownership later moves (T11). Handles are generated, not chosen, for now
(changing one is T16); the migration also rewrote old UUID ids to this form. Alternatives rejected: per-user
uniqueness on the name alone (URLs would need the user in the path anyway), and globally unique names (squatting,
and the `substack` clash the owner wanted to avoid).

## Profile pictures live in SQLite, are raster-only, and are sniffed

A picture is up to 1 MB, in its own table (so listing profiles never reads image bytes), served by an authenticated
route with `nosniff`. The type comes from the file's leading bytes, not the declared Content-Type, and SVG is not
accepted (script, same origin). No object-storage port yet: nothing else needs one, and moving it behind a port is
easy when it does (hosting is D3). The per-user cap on owned profiles (25) bounds storage.

## Validation errors answer `{ error: "message" }`

The `zValidator` default returns a raw zod object, which the UI showed as "[object Object]" (found by an e2e test;
the component tests mocked the server and missed it). `validateJson` (`apps/api/src/validate.ts`) returns the first
problem as a plain message. Only the profile routes use it so far; the rest is T17.

## Email: provider-neutral SMTP; sent after responding; zero-setup default

`SmtpMailer` (nodemailer) works with any provider, so choosing Resend/Postmark/SES is configuration, not code.
`MAIL_TRANSPORT=console` is the default so local development needs no provider; `file` lets e2e tests read the
"inbox"; production refuses anything but `smtp`. Reset emails are sent in the background: awaiting the mail server
would make "this address has an account" observable through response time or a 500 when mail is down. The cost is
that a delivery failure isn't visible to the user, so it is logged (user id + SMTP error code, never the link) and
the SMTP connection is verified at startup.

## Email confirmation: gate sharing, not writing

Unconfirmed accounts can write and use AI features (nothing is exposed to anyone else), but can't invite others:
sharing is the one place an unproven address could leak someone's work. Links are bound to the address they
were sent to, hashed at rest, expire after 24 hours, and only the newest works. Using a link twice succeeds, because
mail scanners and double clicks routinely open links first. Resend is limited to 3/hour per user. Chosen over
blocking sign-in until confirmed because that makes a typo'd address a dead end and turns every mail outage into
a lockout.

## Changing and adding passwords while signed in

Changing needs the current password (guesses are throttled) because a stolen session shouldn't be enough to take
over the account; it signs out all other devices, cancels outstanding reset links, and emails a notice (no
action-token in it, only a link to the normal reset page). Adding a first password to a Google-only account goes
through an emailed link rather than a form: there's no current password to check, and email-link proof of the
inbox is stronger than trusting the session. The cost is that finishing it signs the person out everywhere, which
we accept and tell them about.

## Abandoned unconfirmed accounts are deleted after 14 days of no use

A typo'd or abandoned signup otherwise squats on an address forever (the real owner then can't register).
"Unused" means no drafts, no saved API key and no other people in their profiles, so nobody who has started
using the product loses work; the 14 days is configurable and 0 disables it. It runs as a simple in-process
interval (every 6 hours, 10 s after start, never overlapping, errors logged and retried), not a job queue,
because it's idempotent and cheap, and running on several instances at once is harmless. Deletion uses the same
code as "delete my account" (`removeUserAndOwnedData`) so the two can't drift. No reminder email is sent before
deletion (see T3e); the signup email states the rule up front.
